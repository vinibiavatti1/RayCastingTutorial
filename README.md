### Introduction

RayCasting is a technique to create a 3D projection based on 2D plane. This technique was used for old games when computers didn't have a good performance like today computers. You can find this rendering method in [Wolfstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D) that is considered to be the first 3D game ever. The game [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) uses a similar technique known as [binary space partitioning (BSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning), but this tutorial is focused on the RayCasting implementation only.

### Programming language

The programming language used for this tutorial is Javascript with HTML5. This was choosen because the ease of implementation and because this language has weak-typing, so this is fast to program in. The other reason for this language is that you will not need a lot of resources to execute your code, just a web browser. I recommend to use some IDE, like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for coding.  

### Pre-requisites

The implementation is not so hard, but you have to know the basics of trigonometry, programming language, and graphical programming (canvas). For more details of pre-requisites, check the list below:

- Javascript (Programming language)
- Basic of Trigonometry
- HTML5 Canvas
